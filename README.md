# cost_sharing_calculator
This Python script calculates fair cost sharing among families based on the number of adults and children in each family. Each adult counts as 1 unit of weight, and children count as a fractional unit based on user-defined input. The program determines how much each family should have paid and computes balances to indicate over or underpayment.
